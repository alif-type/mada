Mada
====

![Sample](documentation/FontSample.png)

Mada is a modernist, low contrast Arabic typeface based largely on the typeface
seen in Cairo metro old signage.
Mada is characterised by low descenders, open contours and low contrast forms
making it suitable for small point sizes, user interfaces, signage or low
resolution settings.

Mada can work also as a display typeface giving modernist and simplistic feeling.

Mada comes in 6 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold and Black), as
well as an interpolatable variable font that can provide any intermediate
weight on the fly.
